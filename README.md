In this project, I will be producing a website which contains recipes for certain foods.

I wil be using HTML at the start of this project - and returning at a later date to use CSS.

My ultimate goal of the first half (html side) of this project is to memorise to a good standard, the commands and attributes of the html language, and to submit good commits (shortened titles, good explanations underneath - no periods, capitalise the title, context, omit waffle (I am arguably a professional waffler)(I'm doing it now).
