In this project, I will be producing a website which contains recipes for certain foods.

I wil be using HTML at the start of this project - and returning at a later date to use CSS.

My ultimate goal of the first half (html side) of this project is to memorise to a good standard, the commands and attributes of the html language, and to submit good commits (shortened titles, good explanations underneath - no periods, capitalise the title, context, omit waffle (I am arguably a professional waffler)(I'm doing it now).

Update: I've submitted the first part of the assignment - I will clea up the index.html file when I'm performing the CSS part of the assignment. I have very quickly picked up the html language and have thoroughly enjoyed this part of the assignment.

All recipes have been adapted from BBC good foods, with my own twist.
