        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2tsp olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
            <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
            <li>90g bacon/panchetta</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
            <li>Sprinkle grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>300g lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>White sauce</li>
            <li>125g mozzarella, torn into strips.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying 
                pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 
                10 mins until browned all over.</li>
            <li>Finely chop 4 slices of ham from a 90g pack, then 
                stir through the meat mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe 
                and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then 
                season.</li>
            <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce 
                looks rich.</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 180c (fan)/160c/gas mark 4 and grease tray.</li>
            <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover 
                with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over 
                roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 
                390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
            <li>Scatter mozzarella over the top.</li>
            <li>Arrange the rest of the ham on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top
                is bubbling, lightly browned, and golden.</li>
        </ol>
