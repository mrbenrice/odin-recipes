                onion and 2-3 chopped carrots for a few mins.</p></li>
            <li><p>When soft, turn up the heat, crumble in 500g lamb mince and brown, 
                tipping off any excess fat.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e and a large splash of Worcestershire sauce, 
                then fry for a few mins.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour over 500ml beef stock, bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 
                40 mins, uncovering halfway.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, then make the mash. 
                Boil the 900g potato, cut into chunks, in salted water for 10-15 mins until 
                tender. Drain, then mash with 85g butter and 3 tbsp milk.</p></li>
            <li><p>Put the mince into an ovenproof dish, top with the mash and ruffle with a fork. 
                <em>The pie can now be chilled and frozen for up to a month.</em></p></li>
            <li><p>Bake for 20-25 mins until the top is starting to colour and the mince is 
                bubbling through at the edges. <em>(To bake from frozen, cook at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 
                    for 1 hr-1 hr 20 mins until piping hot in the centre. Flash under the grill to brown,
